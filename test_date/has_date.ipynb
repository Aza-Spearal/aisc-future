      "One Hooper film still in need of a widespread critical// reappraisal is 1995’s THE MANGLER. While Hooper’s films tend to be either beloved or reviled, there’s a whole lot of middle ground that many of his movies are falling through. THE MANGLER, the story of a haunted dryer (yes, you read that correctly) that kills and eats the people who get stuck in it, is one such film.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MANGLER was written by Richard Fire and Steven-Charles J. Sinclair from a story by Fire and Tobe Hooper. Unlike many of the lesser-known Hooper films, this one was actually a studio production. New Line was the studio, and they were the ones who put the money up to give THE MANGLER a huge budget of $11 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE MANGLER is a strange movie, and one that’s a little difficult to describe. It’s essentially a horror film, but it’s not like every other horror film that’s ever been made. The idea of a haunted dryer was so strange and outlandish in the mid-90s that it was almost impossible to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, hey, it’s Tobe Hooper! A lot of people tend to forget that THE MANGLER was a huge hit, especially when you consider how it was marketed. It was a box office\n",

But when Rocky realizes that Marvin’s talent is something special, he has to come to terms with the fact that Marvin may not be able to realize his own potential in the world.\n",

      "Tax Analysts' Worldwide Tax Daily quoted Patricia Gimbel Lewis concerning the IRS's proposed expansion of the role of the U.S. competent authority and// the impact this could have on transfer pricing disputes. The IRS is proposing to amend the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code to enhance the role of the competent authority in resolving certain U.S. transfer pricing issues. The proposed regulation would specifically authorize the competent authority to resolve transfer pricing issues with respect to any tax-treaty partner. Under the current regulations, the competent authority can resolve transfer pricing issues only with respect to a member of the same multinational enterprise group as the U.S. taxpayer, and the authority may resolve transfer pricing issues only if the member is also a resident of a treaty partner. The proposed regulation would also extend the authority to resolve certain transfer pricing issues to a competent authority under an income tax convention to which the United States is not a party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lewis stated, \"The proposed regulation would be a big change for the IRS's transfer pricing practice. It's a very significant proposal, and it's likely to be controversial.\" She added, \"It's important to note that the proposed regulation would not change anything with respect to the substance of a transfer pricing investigation and the statutory requirements for a transfer pricing adjustment. The proposed regulation is merely going to provide another avenue for resolving transfer pricing issues.\"\n",
